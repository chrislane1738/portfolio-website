          I&apos;m just a finance student at community college looking deeper into coding and AI. 
          I&apos;ve always been scared of trying new things; especially things where I feel like I&apos;d 
          sound stupid if I did try them. To overcome this, as well as an attempt to learn more 
          about coding, I made this website (per a friend&apos;s recommendation). Please, view some 
          projects I&apos;m passionate about. I hope you enjoy!
